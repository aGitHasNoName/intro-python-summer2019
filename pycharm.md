# PyCharm

When you open PyCharm, you may be prompted as to whether you want to import settings.  If prompted and you've used PyCharm before, it's your choice what you choose.  If you have not used PyCharm, you can choose not to import anything.

The next screen that may come up is about preferences.  Here's what it looked like on my Mac:

You can choose the bottom left option to "Skip Remaining and Set Defaults."

Next, you'll see the window that will normally come up when opening PyCharm:

Choose Open and then navigate to the folder where you downloaded the files from this repository (likely called intro-python-summer2019-master in your Downloads folder or wherever else you moved it).
